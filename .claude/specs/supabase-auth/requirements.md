# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates Supabase as the authentication backend service to replace or complement the current Django-based authentication system. The integration will provide a modern, scalable authentication solution that works seamlessly with the existing React frontend and TypeScript API layer. The system will maintain compatibility with existing authentication interfaces while leveraging Supabase's built-in authentication features, including social logins, email verification, and session management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Supabase authentication into the existing system, so that we can leverage a modern, scalable authentication service while maintaining compatibility with our current React frontend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured with Supabase THEN it SHALL maintain all existing authentication API endpoints and interfaces
2. WHEN a user authenticates through Supabase THEN the system SHALL return tokens in the same format as the current Django implementation
3. WHEN the Supabase client is initialized THEN it SHALL use environment variables for configuration (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
4. IF Supabase is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account using email and password, so that I can access the application securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid registration data (email, password, name) THEN Supabase SHALL create a new user account
2. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL return access and refresh tokens compatible with existing frontend expectations
3. WHEN a user registers with an existing email THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
4. WHEN registration data is invalid THEN the system SHALL validate and return specific field errors
5. IF email verification is enabled THEN Supabase SHALL send a verification email to the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log in with my email and password, so that I can access my account and use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials THEN Supabase SHALL authenticate the user and return session tokens
2. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL return user profile data in the expected format (id, email, name, created_at, updated_at)
3. WHEN login credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error
4. WHEN a user account is not verified THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate verification error
5. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL update the API client with the new authentication token

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to securely log out of my account, so that my session is properly terminated and my account remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates logout THEN Supabase SHALL invalidate the current session
2. WHEN logout is successful THEN the system SHALL clear all stored authentication tokens
3. WHEN logout is successful THEN the system SHALL reset the user's profile state
4. WHEN logout occurs THEN the API client SHALL remove authentication headers
5. IF logout fails THEN the system SHALL still clear local authentication state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want my session to be automatically maintained, so that I don't have to repeatedly log in during normal usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's session is valid THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh tokens before expiration
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL check for existing valid sessions and restore user state
3. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic token refresh using the refresh token
4. IF token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL clear the session and require re-authentication
5. WHEN session state changes THEN the useAuth hook SHALL update accordingly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to view and update my profile information, so that I can keep my account details current.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests profile data THEN the system SHALL fetch current user information from Supabase
2. WHEN a user updates profile data THEN Supabase SHALL validate and save the changes
3. WHEN profile update is successful THEN the system SHALL return the updated user profile
4. WHEN profile data is invalid THEN the system SHALL return validation errors
5. WHEN updating email THEN the system SHALL handle email verification requirements

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user who forgot my password, I want to reset it using my email address, so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN Supabase SHALL send a reset email if the email exists
2. WHEN a user clicks the reset link THEN they SHALL be able to set a new password
3. WHEN password reset is successful THEN the user SHALL be able to log in with the new password
4. WHEN reset token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error
5. WHEN password reset is completed THEN existing sessions SHALL be invalidated

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want email verification to be enforced, so that user accounts are properly validated and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN Supabase SHALL send an email verification message
2. WHEN a user attempts to log in with an unverified email THEN the system SHALL restrict access and prompt for verification
3. WHEN a user clicks the verification link THEN their account SHALL be marked as verified
4. WHEN verification is needed THEN the user SHALL be able to request a new verification email
5. WHEN email is updated THEN the system SHALL require re-verification of the new email address

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Authentication operations SHALL complete within 2 seconds under normal conditions
- Token refresh operations SHALL be transparent to the user and complete within 1 second
- Session restoration on application startup SHALL complete within 1 second
- The system SHALL cache user profile data to minimize API calls

### Security

- All communication with Supabase SHALL use HTTPS and secure authentication protocols
- Sensitive credentials (API keys, tokens) SHALL be stored securely using environment variables
- Access tokens SHALL have appropriate expiration times (recommended: 1 hour)
- Refresh tokens SHALL be stored securely and rotated regularly
- Password requirements SHALL meet industry standards (minimum 8 characters, complexity rules)
- The system SHALL implement proper CORS policies for frontend communication

### Reliability

- The authentication system SHALL handle network failures gracefully with appropriate error messages
- Session management SHALL be resilient to temporary network interruptions
- The system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms if Supabase services are temporarily unavailable
- Token refresh SHALL implement exponential backoff for retry logic

### Usability

- Authentication errors SHALL provide clear, user-friendly messages
- The login/registration process SHALL integrate seamlessly with the existing UI
- Loading states SHALL be properly managed during authentication operations
- The system SHALL maintain consistent behavior with the existing authentication flow

### Compatibility

- The Supabase integration SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing API interfaces
- Existing TypeScript types and interfaces SHALL be preserved or properly migrated
- The useAuth hook SHALL maintain the same public interface for frontend components
- Database migration strategies SHALL be planned for transitioning from Django to Supabase user management
