## Implementation Notes

### Task Dependencies
- Tasks 1-3 must be completed before any other tasks
- Phase 2 (tasks 4-6) can be executed in parallel
- Phase 3 (tasks 7-9) depends on completion of Phase 2
- Tasks 16-18 can be executed in parallel once Phase 3 is complete
- Phase 7 and 8 should be executed sequentially

### Success Criteria
- All existing functionality preserved during restructuring
- New monorepo structure enables easy addition of packages
- Development workflow is faster and more intuitive
- Build and deployment processes are automated and reliable
- Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date

### Rollback Plan
- Keep backup of original structure until validation complete
- Each task should be reversible with clear rollback steps
- Test functionality after each major phase completion
