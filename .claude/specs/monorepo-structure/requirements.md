# Requirements: Monorepo Structure Initialization (AI-First Modular Monorepo)


## Overview
Transform the project into a scalable, modular monorepo for rapid prototyping and real-world system design. The structure should support multiple apps (frontend, backend), shared code, and infrastructure, with AI-first workflows, best-in-class free tools, and seamless developer experience.

## Requirements


### Requirement 1: Modular Workspace & Structure
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a monorepo with clear modular boundaries (frontend, backend, shared, infra), so I can prototype, scale, and maintain multiple apps and services efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the root workspace is set up THEN the system SHALL define workspaces for frontend, backend, shared, and infra
2. WHEN packages are installed THEN the system SHALL hoist shared dependencies to the root
3. WHEN workspace scripts are run THEN the system SHALL support running commands across all packages (e.g., dev, build, test)
4. IF a new module is added THEN the system SHALL allow easy extension with minimal config


### Requirement 2: Shared Tooling, Linting, and Style
**User Story:** As a developer, I want unified linting, formatting, and code style across all packages, so that quality and experience are consistent and onboarding is easy.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run shared linting, formatting, and commit checks (ESLint, Prettier, CommitLint, Husky)
2. WHEN TypeScript is used THEN the system SHALL use a shared base config with package-level overrides
3. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL support unified and package-specific test runners (Jest, Playwright, etc.)
4. IF a package needs custom config THEN the system SHALL allow local overrides without breaking the shared setup


### Requirement 3: Dev Scripts & AI-First Workflows
**User Story:** As a developer, I want simple scripts and AI-powered workflows, so I can start, build, test, and deploy everything with a single command or prompt.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN development is started THEN the system SHALL provide a single command to start all dev servers (e.g., `npm run dev:all`)
2. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL build all packages respecting dependencies
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL run all tests (unit, integration, E2E) across packages
4. WHEN using Claude Code or AI tools THEN the system SHALL support spec-driven and automated workflows


### Requirement 4: Package Structure & Shared Code
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear, logical structure with shared code and types, so that modules are easy to understand, extend, and reuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN packages are created THEN the system SHALL follow clear naming and folder conventions (frontend, backend, shared, infra)
2. WHEN shared code is needed THEN the system SHALL provide a `shared/` package for types, utils, and config
3. WHEN packages need to reference each other THEN the system SHALL enable internal dependencies via workspace linking
4. WHEN new features are added THEN the structure SHALL remain scalable and maintainable


### Requirement 5: Dependency Management & Security
**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient, secure dependency management, so that packages are optimized, up-to-date, and safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL deduplicate and hoist shared deps to the root
2. WHEN security issues are found THEN the system SHALL support easy auditing and updates (e.g., Snyk, npm audit)
3. WHEN conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution and documentation
4. WHEN new packages are added THEN dependency management SHALL remain simple and scalable


### Requirement 6: Build, Deploy, and CI/CD
**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust build and deployment pipelines, so I can deploy individual modules or the whole app efficiently, with CI/CD and preview deploys.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL support both per-package and full monorepo builds
2. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL enable independent and full-app deploys (e.g., Vercel, Render, Railway)
3. WHEN CI/CD runs THEN the system SHALL support jobs for changed packages only (e.g., GitHub Actions matrix)
4. WHEN build artifacts are generated THEN the system SHALL organize them consistently and cleanly


### Requirement 7: Developer Experience & Onboarding
**User Story:** As a new developer, I want a frictionless setup and clear docs, so I can contribute quickly and confidently to any part of the monorepo.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN setting up THEN the system SHALL provide a single command to install all dependencies and set up the dev environment
2. WHEN IDE config is needed THEN the system SHALL provide recommended settings and extensions (e.g., VS Code)
3. WHEN onboarding THEN the system SHALL include clear setup, contribution, and environment docs
4. WHEN env vars are needed THEN the system SHALL provide `.env.example` templates and documentation

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Package installation and builds should be fast (hoisting, parallelism, hot reload)

### Maintainability
- DRY configs, clear structure, up-to-date dependencies, easy to extend

### Developer Experience
- Intuitive scripts, clear errors, minimal context switching, great onboarding

### Scalability
- Easy to add new modules, tools, and frameworks; build system scales with project size
