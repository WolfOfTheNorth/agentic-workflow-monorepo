# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive user authentication functionality for the agentic workflow application, including a home screen that prompts users to signup and login. The system will leverage Supabase Auth as the backend authentication service, providing secure user registration, login, and session management. The implementation covers both frontend React components and backend integration, with extensibility for future authentication methods including Google login, two-factor authentication, and biometric authentication.


## Requirements

**Note:** For detailed implementation requirements and up-to-date technical details, see the [supabase-auth requirements and design documents](../../supabase-auth/requirements.md) in this folder. This document focuses on user-facing and architectural requirements, while the supabase-auth folder contains the canonical technical requirements for authentication.

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the application, I want to see a home screen that prompts me to log in or sign up, so that I can easily access authentication options and understand what actions are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user visits the application THEN they SHALL be presented with a home screen showing login and signup options
2. WHEN the home screen is displayed THEN it SHALL provide clear calls-to-action for both existing users (login) and new users (signup)
3. WHEN a user clicks the login option THEN they SHALL be navigated to the login form
4. WHEN a user clicks the signup option THEN they SHALL be navigated to the registration form
5. WHEN an authenticated user visits the home screen THEN they SHALL be redirected to the main application dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account using email and password, so that I can access the application securely and create my personal workspace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid registration data (email, password, name) THEN Supabase SHALL create a new user account
2. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL return access and refresh tokens
3. WHEN a user registers with an existing email THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
4. WHEN registration data is invalid THEN the system SHALL validate and return specific field errors
5. WHEN registration is successful THEN the user SHALL be automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log in with my email and password, so that I can access my account and use the application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials THEN Supabase SHALL authenticate the user and return session tokens
2. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL return user profile data (id, email, name, created_at)
3. WHEN login credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL return a clear authentication error
4. WHEN login is successful THEN the user SHALL be redirected to the main dashboard
5. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL update the authentication state throughout the application

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to securely log out of my account, so that my session is properly terminated and my account remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates logout THEN Supabase SHALL invalidate the current session
2. WHEN logout is successful THEN the system SHALL clear all stored authentication tokens
3. WHEN logout is successful THEN the system SHALL reset the user's authentication state
4. WHEN logout occurs THEN the user SHALL be redirected to the home screen
5. IF logout fails THEN the system SHALL still clear local authentication state for security

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want my session to be automatically maintained, so that I don't have to repeatedly log in during normal usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's session is valid THEN the system SHALL automatically maintain authentication state
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL check for existing valid sessions and restore user state
3. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic token refresh
4. IF token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL clear the session and redirect to login
5. WHEN session state changes THEN all authenticated components SHALL update accordingly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user who forgot my password, I want to reset it using my email address, so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN Supabase SHALL send a reset email if the email exists
2. WHEN a user clicks the reset link THEN they SHALL be able to set a new password
3. WHEN password reset is successful THEN the user SHALL be able to log in with the new password
4. WHEN reset token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error
5. WHEN password reset is completed THEN existing sessions SHALL be invalidated for security

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to be extensible for future enhancements, so that we can easily add Google login, 2FA, and biometric authentication as mentioned in the roadmap.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. The authentication architecture SHALL expose a provider interface to allow easy addition of new authentication methods (e.g., Google, 2FA, biometrics) without major refactoring.
2. The authentication interface SHALL be abstracted to allow future Google login integration and other providers.
3. The system SHALL include hooks for future two-factor authentication (2FA) and other multi-factor methods.
4. The user interface SHALL accommodate additional authentication methods without major restructuring.
5. Authentication state management SHALL support multiple authentication factors.
6. The system SHALL provide a migration plan and scripts for moving user data from Django to Supabase, including mapping of user IDs and handling of legacy sessions.
7. Database migration strategies SHALL be planned for transitioning from Django to Supabase user management.

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling, validation, and monitoring, so that users receive clear feedback and the system remains secure and auditable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. All authentication errors SHALL be logged for audit purposes, excluding sensitive user data.
2. The system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages for all authentication failures, without exposing internal error details.
3. When authentication operations fail, the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages.
4. When network errors occur, the system SHALL handle them gracefully with appropriate feedback.
5. When validation fails, the system SHALL highlight specific field errors.
6. When rate limiting is triggered, the system SHALL inform users and suggest retry timing.
7. When system errors occur, sensitive information SHALL NOT be exposed in error messages.
8. The system SHALL monitor authentication endpoints for unusual activity and alert administrators of potential security incidents.
9. All authentication flows SHALL have automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Passwords SHALL require at least 8 characters, including one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character
