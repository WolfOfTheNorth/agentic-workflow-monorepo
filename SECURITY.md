# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### Private Disclosure

**Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@yourproject.com](mailto:security@yourproject.com)
2. **Subject**: Include "SECURITY VULNERABILITY" in the subject line
3. **Details**: Provide as much information as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: 2-4 weeks (depending on complexity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and users have time to update

## Security Measures

### Automated Security Scanning

This project uses several automated security measures:

#### Dependency Scanning

- **pnpm audit**: Automated vulnerability scanning of all dependencies
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates for security patches
- **Custom Security Audit Tool**: Enhanced vulnerability analysis and reporting

```bash
# Run security audit
npm run security:audit

# Run with fixes
npm run security:audit-fix

# CI-friendly audit (fails on high/critical)
npm run security:audit-ci
```

#### Dependency Validation

- **Version Conflict Detection**: Identifies conflicting dependency versions
- **Peer Dependency Validation**: Ensures peer dependencies are satisfied
- **Outdated Package Detection**: Monitors for outdated dependencies

```bash
# Validate dependencies
npm run deps:validate

# Check for outdated packages
npm run deps:outdated

# Preview fixes
npm run deps:validate-fix
```

### Code Quality & Security

#### Static Analysis

- **ESLint**: Code quality and security linting
- **TypeScript**: Type safety to prevent runtime errors
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting

#### Pre-commit Hooks

- Security linting on all staged files
- Dependency validation before commits
- Automated formatting and quality checks

#### CI/CD Security

- Security audits run on every pull request
- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- Secrets scanning (if configured)

### Dependency Management

#### Workspace Security

- All workspace packages use `workspace:*` protocol for internal dependencies
- Regular security audits across all packages in the monorepo
- Centralized dependency management to reduce attack surface

#### Update Strategy

- **Critical/High Severity**: Immediate updates (within 24 hours)
- **Moderate Severity**: Weekly updates
- **Low Severity**: Monthly updates
- **Major Version Updates**: Manual review and testing required

### Environment Security

#### Development Environment

- `.env` files excluded from version control
- Environment variable validation
- Secure defaults for all configuration

#### Production Security

- Environment-specific configuration
- Secrets management integration
- Container security best practices (if using Docker)

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**

   ```bash
   npm run deps:outdated
   npm run security:audit
   ```

2. **Validate Changes**

   ```bash
   npm run deps:validate
   npm run security:audit
   ```

3. **Use Security Tools**
   - Run security audits before submitting PRs
   - Review Dependabot PRs promptly
   - Report any suspicious dependencies or behavior

### For Maintainers

1. **Regular Security Reviews**
   - Weekly dependency audits
   - Monthly security policy reviews
   - Quarterly threat model updates

2. **Incident Response**
   - Have a security incident response plan
   - Maintain communication channels for security issues
   - Keep security contact information updated

3. **Access Control**
   - Use principle of least privilege
   - Regularly review repository access
   - Enable two-factor authentication

## Security Tools Configuration

### pnpm Audit Configuration

The project uses pnpm's built-in audit functionality enhanced with custom tooling:

```json
{
  "audit": {
    "level": "moderate",
    "exclude": []
  }
}
```

### Dependabot Configuration

Located at `.github/dependabot.yml`:

- Weekly updates for all package ecosystems
- Grouped updates for related dependencies
- Security updates prioritized
- Automatic PR creation with proper labeling

### Custom Security Scripts

- `tools/dev/security-audit.js`: Enhanced security auditing
- `tools/dev/dependency-validator.js`: Dependency conflict resolution
- Integrated with CI/CD pipeline for automated security checks

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

### Example Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported privately
2. **Day 1-2**: Initial assessment and acknowledgment
3. **Day 3-7**: Detailed analysis and fix development
4. **Day 8-14**: Testing and validation of fix
5. **Day 15**: Security update released
6. **Day 30**: Public disclosure (if appropriate)

### Public Disclosure
